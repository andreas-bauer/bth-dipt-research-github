# Research at the Department for Software Engineering (DIPT) at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH)

Welcome to a collection of research-related resources created and compiled by members of the Department of Software Engineering and Blekinge Institute of Technology (Karlskrona, Sweden). See [the official website](https://www.bth.se/eng/about-bth/departments/softwareengineering/) for more information on DIPT and BTH.

## Research-related Resources

### 💾 Code

- [Nested cross-validation with SetFit](https://github.com/bth-dipt-research/SVAR/tree/main/setfitclassifier) (now with less memory leakage 🥳)

  SetFit is a few-shot fine-tuning framework for sentence transformers. It is especially useful with little labeled data (< 100 data points). See paper here: [Efficient Few-Short Learning Without Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11055). The code we provide implements nested cross-validation to optimize the hyper-parameters _and_ estimate the performance of the classifier.

### ⚒️ Support Tools

- [Rejoinderoo](https://github.com/andreas-bauer/rejoinderoo) - Rejoinderoo creates a rejoinder (response to reviewers) LaTeX document based on a CSV file.

- [CRediT Maker](https://github.com/andreas-bauer/credit-maker) - CRedit Maker helps you to create CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) statements for your research papers.
